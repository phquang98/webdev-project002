  - [ ] signUp page === good opportunity for some practice with form

- [ ] play around with React hooks in here

## Notes

WARNING: `.gitigonre` remove `/build` just to make a Github Pages for easy viewing.

- if want to use `div` as a button, read [this](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/HEAD/docs/rules/no-static-element-interactions.md) first
- use `keyDown`, `keyPress` deprecated
